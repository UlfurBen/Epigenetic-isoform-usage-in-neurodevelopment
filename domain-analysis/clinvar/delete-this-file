# This code inputs a clinvar missense variant file for a gene and outputs a tab delimited file containing chromosome, genomic position, original base, variant base.

# That file is then run on the website https://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/cgi-bin/VarSite/GetPage.pl?varmap=TRUE# to get the protein position
